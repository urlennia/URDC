Whitepaper - Urlennian Digital Coin (URDC)
<br><br>
1. Abstract
The Urlennian Digital Coin(URDC) is a type of cryptocurrency that is referred to as a commodity-backed stablecoin, meaning it is backed by reserve assets in a decentralized financial system, such as gold, platinum, and mineral assets. In the case of URDC, it is designed to be pegged to 9% of the Urlennian gross national product(GNP) and secured 1:1 by real world commodities.

2. Vision & Mission
To establish the Urlennian Digital Coin (URDC) as the commodity-backed stable cryptocurrency of the future, providing financial autonomy, reducing dependency on traditional banking systems, and fostering global economic inclusion.

Our mission is to leverage cutting-edge blockchain technology to create a stable, secure, and scalable digital currency that powers daily transactions, government services, and international trade. Through transparent governance and strategic partnerships, URDC will become a key player in the emerging decentralized economy.

3. Tokenomics

Total Supply:

The total supply of URDC will be capped at 3 trillion tokens to ensure scarcity and prevent inflation.

Initial Supply: 1 billion URDC.
Max Supply: 1 trillion URDC (inflationary models will be in place to prevent sudden large increases).

Token Distribution:

50% – Government Treasury & Reserves: Ensures stability, governance, and funding for national projects.
20% – Public Sale: Offered during an ICO or IEO to raise funds for development and expansion.
15% – Development Fund: For ongoing project development, partnerships, and technology improvements.
10% – Community Rewards & Incentives: For early adopters, staking, and community growth.
5% – Advisors and Partnerships: Allocated to strategic partners and advisors.

4. Use Cases:

Governance: URDC will be used for voting and governance within the Urlennian Treasury.

Payments: Nationals can use URDC for everyday transactions, government taxes, and international payments.

Staking and Yield Farming: Investors and users can stake their URDC to earn rewards.

International Remittances: Facilitate low-cost, fast remittances between countries.

5. Blockchain Technology

The Urlennian Digital Coin is built on the Polygon blockchain to leverage its speed, low transaction costs, and scalability. Polygon is one of the leading Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, allowing for fast transactions and a significant reduction in gas fees compared to Ethereum. This makes URDC an ideal choice for everyday transactions and global payments, offering users a seamless experience without the high costs typically associated with traditional blockchain networks.
Security:
Polygon’s robust security model ensures that URDC transactions are both fast and secure, with low risk of attacks or failures.
Stable:
Every token in circulation is backed one-for-one by a matching reserve of commodity money, such as silver, platinum, or gold. This ensures that the value of each token is safeguarded by tangible, trusted assets, offering unparalleled security and confidence in every transaction.
Scalability:
The Polygon network supports thousands of transactions per second, ensuring that URDC can scale as demand for the token grows.
Sustainability:
Polygon’s energy-efficient design ensures that URDC operates within an environmentally sustainable framework, unlike many other blockchains that rely on high energy consumption for consensus.

6. Governance

The governance model of URDC is built around transparency and accountability, with the Urlennian Treasury overseeing key decisions related to the token’s development and utilization. Governance will be conducted via on-chain voting, allowing nationals and stakeholders to participate directly in decision-making processes, such as the allocation of funds, future updates to the tokenomics, and the introduction of new services.
Decentralized Governance:
Voting rights are distributed among URDC holders based on the amount they own, ensuring that decisions are made by the community.
Major decisions, such as altering the token supply or introducing new functionalities, will require a supermajority vote.
Transparency:
All decisions, financial transactions, and development updates will be publicly available through blockchain records, ensuring the highest level of accountability.
